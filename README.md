# Forty Points Clear
## Ariel Aguilar Gonzalez

This project uses historical Engligh Premier League (EPL) tables to understand the how many points a team will need to earn in a typical EPL season to avoid relegation. By using a logistic regression model, its possible to estimate the probability of relegation associated with a given points total. The result suggest that the old manager maxim "forty points clear", doesn't gurantee safety from relegation.

Data on historical EPL tables was pulled from Wikipedia.
